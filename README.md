# Project: Dignify®

Electronic medical records (EMR) or electronic health records (EHR) have been shown to improve quality patient care and an efficient way to give providers quality data for continuity of patient care. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines an EHR as a “repository of patient data in digital form, stored and exchanged securely, and accessible by multiple authorized users. It contains retrospective, concurrent, and prospective information and its primary purpose is to support continuing, efficient, and quality integrated health care.”

Even though Physicians and other care providers require high quality information to make sound clinical decisions, their information needs are often not met in most developing countries. 

This app serves as an affordable lightweight solution for patient data intake.
